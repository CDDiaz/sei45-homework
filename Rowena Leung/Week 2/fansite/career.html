    <h4>SAGE Project</h4>

    <p class="sage">From 1961 to 1963, after working at MIT's meteorology department, Hamilton worked on SAGE (Semi Automatic Ground Environment). This was a natural transition as the SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, the aim of which was to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements through simulators. SAGE built on this foundation to create a system for anti-aircraft air defense from potential Soviet attacks during the Cold War. The system at Lincoln Labs, hidden deep inside caverns,was huge and was the first to have realtime computers. Hamilton's role here was to write software for the XD-1, the first AN/FSQ-7 computer. </p>

<p>It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software </p>

  <div class="career-apollo">
    <h4>Apollo Program</h4>
    <p>During the time of the Apollo space missions, Hamilton led the team that created the on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo command modules and lunar modules. She was in charge of the Apollo (and Skylab) on-board flight software effort while also serving as Director of the Software Engineering Division at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory. Her work was a monumental task at a time when computer technology was in its infancy: The astronauts had access to only 72 kilobytes of computer memory (a 64-gigabyte cell phone today carries almost a million times more storage space). Programmers had to use paper punch cards to write and feed information into room-sized computers with no screen interface.</p>

      <blockquote><p><em>"Computer science and software engineering were not yet courses to be taught (or disciplines to be named). These were pioneering times. Learning was by "being" and "doing" on the job; as more people came on board, the more I became an "expert" and rose up through the ranks. A real world system developed in uncharted territory, one could not have asked for a better research environment to set the stage for what would come next and remain thereafter (a life long career centered around developing more advanced methods and tools for designing systems and developing software)." - Margaret Hamilton, NASA. </em><p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Hamilton focussed on system error detection and data recovery in a computer crash at a time when it was very difficult and laborious to identify and fix errors. With her Priority Displays error detection and recovery programs, she created new man in the loop concepts that provided the ability for the on-board flight software to communicate asynchronously in real-time with the astronaut within a distributed system of systems environment. This allowed the software (running in parallel with the astronauts) to interrupt the astronauts and replace their normal displays with priority displays; in order to warn them in case of an emergency during an Apollo mission,like during the Apollo 11 landing.
    </p>
    <p>Hamilton would go on to work on the software for all the Apollo manned, and a few of the unmanned missions, Skylab on-board flight software and initial system software requirements for the Space Shuttle</p>

  <h4>Business and Higher Order Software</h4>
  <p>In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS)to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working on the Apollo program. They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT. It was successfully used in numerous government programs including a project to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language developed by the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project. In 1980, British-Israeli computer scientist David Harel published a proposal for a structured programming language derived from HOS from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals. Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers, and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems.

Hamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984 and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of development before the fact for systems design and software development.</p>
