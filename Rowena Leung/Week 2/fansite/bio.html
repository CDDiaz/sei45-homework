  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Margaret H. Hamilton is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. Born on August 17, 1936 in Paoli, Indiana, USA, in 1958 she gained a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College, a Quaker liberal arts school. After graduation she postponed her own postgraduate studies in abstract maths for 3 years in order to support her husband while he worked towards his degree at Harvard Law. This led to her embarking on a career in software that was more by chance than design.</p>

    <p>She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program. She later founded two software companiesâ€”Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>She is one of the people credited with coining the term "software engineering". </p>
