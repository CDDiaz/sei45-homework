      <h3>Heroku, the leading open Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and a salesforce.com company (NYSE: CRM), has announced that Yukihiro Matsumoto, creator of the free and open source Ruby programming language, will join Heroku as Chief Architect of Ruby.</h3>

      <p class="news">"As a member of our platform development team, Matsumoto-san will continue his work on the Ruby language in close collaboration with the Ruby community, keeping the language open and advancing the technology in exciting new ways. Matz will further accelerate innovation for Ruby and make it even friendlier for developers to build world-class apps," said Heroku GM and SVP of Platforms for salesforce.com, Byron Sebastian.</p>
      <p class="news">Since its public release in 1995, the Ruby programming language has spawned a large and rapidly growing following and ecosystem of Ruby-based, complementary technologies. Used by a million developers worldwide, Ruby runs many of the world's most popular brands, from Comcast and Best Buy to AT&T's Yellow pages, Hulu, and Twitter. Ruby has become the leading development language used to write next generation apps that are social, collaborative, and provide real-time information across mobile devices. Today, Heroku powers more than 150,000 apps written by Ruby developers.</p>
      <p class="news">"I decided to join Heroku because they are committed to openness and developing Ruby further," said Matsumoto. "I want to make the Ruby development experience even richer, more natural and more productive than ever for all Ruby developers."</p>
      <p class="news">Matsumoto will continue his work as research fellow of the Network Applied Communication Laboratory, an open source systems integrator company in Shimane Prefecture, Japan. He will also retain his position as fellow at Rakuten Institute of Technology, an R&D organization affiliated with Rakuten, Japan's largest e-commerce company.</p>
      <p class="news">Heroku was founded in 2007 by application developers for application developers, with the goal of making the deployment and management of next-generation cloud apps as easy as their development. The application platform features a workflow and interface designed around how developers work. Because the platform is a service, there are no virtual machines to manage, no software to install, and no hardware to manage.</p>

      <h3>“I Gave Up on Getting Developers to Act Against Their Instincts.” Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby Creator</h3>

      <p class="news">Language designers want to make progress, make changes, improve the language. But if it comes at the cost of compatibility, that is not good. We try to keep compatibility as much as we can.</p>
      <p class="news">Before the pandemic, I attended many conferences and talked with people about Ruby, and programming in general, so that I could see the obstacles, the irritations, or the drawbacks of the language and the environments, and then I tried to improve them. These kinds of talks and conversations inspired me a lot. And that's one big drawback of the pandemic, that I couldn’t have those kinds of conversations any longer, for the last year and a half.</p>
      <p class="news">So, the cost of the changes is getting bigger and bigger each year. That means that Ruby design decisions cannot be reversed. That means the designers cannot make mistakes. I'm only human, and I admit that I make many mistakes. At the same time, while the Ruby community is big, our Ruby core developer team is not big enough to predict the future.</p>
      <p class="news">Once our core community is big enough to experiment internally, we will no longer need the process of public experiments. But, right now, it is a compromise.</p>
